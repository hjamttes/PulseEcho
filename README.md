# PulseEcho

**PulseEcho** is a multi-band HF CW transceiver built on a Raspberry Pi with a touchscreen interface.  
It allows sending and receiving CW messages across shortwave bands, with real-time CW ↔ English translation.

## How to Use

1. Power on the Raspberry Pi and display.  
2. Type your message on the touchscreen or use a CW paddle.  
3. The software converts your input to CW and transmits it.  
4. Incoming CW is automatically decoded and displayed in English.  

## Why I Made This

I wanted a **custom, build-from-scratch HF transceiver** for nationwide CW communications without relying on pre-made kits.  
It also combines **modern touchscreen interaction with classic Morse code** for learning and practical use.
